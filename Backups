Making backups for important systems and servers I would implement the following:
1. Make sure a RAID is implemented on the system as needed (Preferably a RAID 6)
2. Have a Year, 6 months, month, and week backup image on hand in a secure system (preferably offline or isolated)
  - Change the timing of images as seen as need for the current system
3. Implement a yearly archive backup for important info and configurations (Also preferably offline or isolated) 
  - Then take these HDDs and store them in a secure location that can be installed into a system as needed
4. Automate these processes as much as possible (with an imaging system that puts info onto an encrypted usb)

When making backups for end hosts I would implement the following:
1. Implement constant backups (when connected ot the internet like with crashplan or another system) 
  - If this can't be done then implement a weekly backup system for all the files on the end host
  - Preferably in an automated way so hosts don't need to be bothered by it and having to teach everyone what to do
2. Implement the files as apart of the yearly archive backup for needed files. 
3. Store the HDDs in a secure location (hopefully protected
