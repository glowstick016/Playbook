When encountering an issue with an infected computer the following steps would be taken:
  1. Read the issue to better understand what is happening and on what machine
  2. Quarentine the computer and the do some of the following:
    - Remove from the network via firewall or physical connections 
    - Image the computer to run in a quarentine environment 
    - Put on a fake network to watch what they're doing
  3. Implement a backup system to take over the workload if needed to keep everything running (If needed)
  4. Look through the logs to figure out where the issue originated from. 
  5. Lookup information as needed to help fix the issue once found 
  6. Reimage the system with backup images 
  7. Implement the fix that was found 
    - Or if not found / not worthwhile to fix implement the system in a secure matter to help lower the chances of infection 
  8. Reimplement the system into production 
  9. Watch over the system for a couple days to make sure everything is working as it should be.
